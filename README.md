# Webdev
As part of my audition for the Front-End Developer role, I developed a fully functional Admin Dashboard in just one day. I began learning front-end development yesterday, and this project represents my first hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Features
User Management: Fetches user data from an API and displays it in a table format.
View Posts: Allows users to view posts related to a specific user.
Search Functionality: Implemented search bar functionality to filter users by name.
Responsive Design: The dashboard adjusts for different screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Navigation: Sidebar for easy switching between the Users and Posts sections.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: Used for styling, layout using Flexbox and Grid.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity, fetching data from the API, implementing the search bar, and handling dynamic content.
